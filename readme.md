# Hecto
A text editor written in Rust!

___

This is a personal project mainly to learn Rust by implementing a text editor. 
I'm follow the Hecto guide written by Philipp Flenker mentioned below in the sources. 
My goal is to learn a thing or two about writing idiomatic rust code,
and finish the guided project. I'd also like to extend the editor in the future with stuff I find missing.

###### Progress: Chapter 4, Scrolling

### Compiling and running

Clone the repository and make sure to install Rust with Rustup.
You can compile and run the program by typing `cargo run [filename]` on the commandline.
